# LND Dashboard

This is a dashboard for interacting with and inspecting your `lnd` node.

## Getting started

This assumes you have a running `lnd` node on the Bitcoin testnet, using macaroon authentication.

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

:zap: Go to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000), and you're done! :zap:

## Running in developer mode

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

This turns on auto reload every time you make a change in a file.

Pull requests are welcome!
